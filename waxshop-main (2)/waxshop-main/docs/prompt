FULL-STACK E-COMMERCE PROJECT PROMPT
Build a full-stack e-commerce web application using Java (Spring Boot), Angular (as a Single-Page Application), and SQL Server. The application must be containerized using Docker and runnable with a single docker-compose up command.

This project simulates a simplified version of Lazada/Shopee and focuses on core e-commerce features, including product image upload.

1. Architecture
Frontend: Angular SPA using Angular Router and HttpClient

Backend: Spring Boot with RESTful APIs, JWT-based authentication, and file upload support

Database: SQL Server, connected via JDBC

Containerization: Docker and Docker Compose (backend, frontend, and database)

2. User Roles
User:

Register and log in

View products

Add to cart and checkout

View past orders

Admin:

Log in with admin role

Manage products (create, upload image, edit, delete)

View all user orders

3. Authentication and Authorization
JWT-based authentication

Token stored in frontend and sent with API requests

Route-based access control for user vs admin

4. Functional Requirements
For Users:

Register

Log in

Browse product list

View product details

Add items to shopping cart

View and edit cart

Checkout (with name and shipping address)

View order history

For Admin:

Log in as admin

Add, edit, delete products (with image upload)

View all user orders with details

5. Database Schema (Simplified)
User: id, email, password, role

Category: id, name

Product: id, name, price, stock, description, image_url, category_id

Order: id, user_id, date, status

OrderItem: id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price

6. Angular SPA Routes
/ – Homepage / product list

/product/:id – Product detail page

/cart – Cart page

/checkout – Checkout page

/orders – User order history

/login – Login page

/register – Register page

/admin/products – Admin: manage products

/admin/orders – Admin: manage orders

7. Docker Requirements
Spring Boot backend container

Angular frontend container (served via Nginx or ng serve)

SQL Server database container

All services connected via a single docker-compose.yml

Uploads folder exposed via Docker volume for image persistence

8. Constraints
Must be buildable and testable in 5 days

Focus on essential logic and functionality only

No third-party payment gateway integration

Keep UI simple and minimal

Make everything as simple as possible
